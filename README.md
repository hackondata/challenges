HackOn(Data) Challenges
========================

# Challenges:

- [HackOn(Data) Challenge 01: TV Network Channels List - Data Cleansing Task](challenge_1.md) 


## What's a challenge and how is it different from workshop exercises prior to the final event?

We have over 300 sign-ups for HackOn(Data), but only 100 spots! We will choose participants for the main event based on their HackOn(Data) points.
Participants who did not participate in workshops and did not work on exercises have not received any points to demonstrate their skills and commitment for the final event yet. This is the first challenge that will give you an opportunity to show your skills and commitment for participating in HackOn(Data) final event.
If you have not gained any points yet this is your opportunity to gain points.
